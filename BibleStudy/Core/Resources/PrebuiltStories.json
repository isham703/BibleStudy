As Jesse's sons passed before him, Samuel was impressed by each one's appearance—surely one of these tall, strong men was God's chosen.\n\nBut God had other plans. \"Do not consider his appearance or his height,\" the Lord told Samuel. \"The Lord does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.\"\n\nSeven sons passed before Samuel, and none was chosen. \"Are these all your sons?\" Samuel asked. Jesse replied, \"There is still the youngest, but he is tending the sheep.\" They sent for David, and when the ruddy, handsome youth arrived, the Lord said, \"Rise and anoint him; this is the one.\"",
