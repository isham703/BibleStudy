Today we're exploring one of the most powerful parables Jesus ever told: the story of the Good Samaritan from Luke chapter 10.

A lawyer approaches Jesus with a question: "Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?" Jesus, as he often does, answers with a question: "What is written in the Law? How do you read it?"

The lawyer responds correctly, quoting the great commandment: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and love your neighbor as yourself."

Jesus affirms him: "You have answered correctly. Do this and you will live."

But the lawyer, wanting to justify himself, asks a follow-up question that has echoed through the centuries: "And who is my neighbor?"

This question reveals the lawyer's heart. He wants to draw boundaries. He wants to know the minimum requirement. Who exactly must I love? Who can I exclude?

Jesus responds not with a theological definition, but with a story. A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat him and departed, leaving him half dead.

The road from Jerusalem to Jericho was notoriously dangerous. It descended over 3,000 feet in just 17 miles, winding through rocky wilderness. Bandits could easily hide and ambush travelers.

Now by chance a priest was going down that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. Likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.

Why did these religious leaders pass by? Perhaps they feared ritual defilement from touching what might be a corpse. Perhaps they feared the robbers might still be nearby. Perhaps they simply had somewhere more important to be.

Whatever their reasons, their religious observance took precedence over human need. Their theology became an excuse for indifference.

But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was, and when he saw him, he had compassion.

This is the shocking twist. Samaritans and Jews were bitter enemies. They had centuries of animosity. No respectable Jewish audience would expect a Samaritan to be the hero.

Yet this Samaritan did what the religious leaders would not. He went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him.

The next day, he took out two denarii, about two days' wages, and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, "Take care of him, and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back."

The Samaritan didn't just offer a momentary kindness. He made a long-term commitment. He invested his time, his resources, and his reputation to care for a stranger, a member of a people who despised him.

Jesus then asks the lawyer: "Which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?"

Notice how Jesus flips the question. The lawyer asked "Who is my neighbor?" essentially asking who qualifies for my love. Jesus asks instead, "Who proved to be a neighbor?" making it about action rather than categorization.

The lawyer can't even bring himself to say "the Samaritan." He simply answers, "The one who showed him mercy."

Jesus says to him, "You go, and do likewise."

Friends, this parable challenges us to examine our own hearts. Are we more like the priest and Levite, finding religious reasons to avoid messy involvement with people in need? Or are we willing, like the Samaritan, to cross boundaries of prejudice and convenience to show mercy?

The question is never "Who qualifies as my neighbor?" The question is "Am I being a neighbor?" Love is not about finding the minimum. Love is about going the distance. Love sees a person in need and responds with compassion, regardless of who they are or what it might cost us.

May God give us eyes to see the wounded along our road. May he give us hearts moved by compassion. And may he give us hands willing to bind up wounds and feet willing to go out of our way to serve.

Let us be neighbors. Amen.
